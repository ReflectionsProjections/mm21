+++++ INITIAL RUN (Mac/Linux) +++++
To run the vagrant VM for the first time, cd into this folder and type 'vagrant up' in Terminal.

Once the machine boots, it should give you a login screen. The username and password are both 'vagrant' (without the quote marks of course).

When you've logged in, type 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop' followed by 'startx' to bring up the Ubuntu GUI.

When you're done, simply 'Power off' the machine in VirtualBox OR type 'vagrant halt' to have Vagrant shut down the machine for you.

+++++ FUTURE RUNS (Mac/Linux) +++++
To run the Vagrant VM again, start it from VirtualBox like you would any other VirtualBox VM OR run it with 'vagrant up' from the command line. Shut it down using either VirtualBox's 'Power off' or 'vagrant halt'.

+++++ INITIAL RUN (Windows) +++++
TODO - I don't really use my Windows dev machine...
